Scripts for SLiM simulations associated with Robinson et al. 2021 bioRxiv

To make simulation scripts for main model (including & excluding deleterious mutations), simply run:  
```
./make_slim_scripts.sh
```

Other simulation parameters (e.g., mutation rates, DFE, dominance distribution, etc) were varied by manually editing the simulation script.
